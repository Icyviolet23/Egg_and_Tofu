# Egg and Tofu
Eggs and tofus are raining from the sky! These food are generated according to the beats of the background music, with a rare tofu appearing very occasionally alongside eggs. To avoid being hit by the falling food, you would have to slice these falling food on the screen before they reach the ground. To do this, you can utilise your flashlight on your phone and wave it in front of your webcam to slice the food. There will be a line appearing on the screen indicating the slicing path of your flashlight. Try to get as many of the food as possible before the music ends. Good luck! :)
